## 🎉 **Priority 2 COMPLETED Successfully**

Priority 2 has been **100% completed** with comprehensive architecture improvements that transform the Maker-Kit codebase into an enterprise-grade application with proper dependency injection, command pattern, and async/sync separation.

## 📊 **What Was Accomplished**

### **✅ Task 2.1: Dependency Injection Container** (COMPLETED)

- **Execution** - Safe execution with error handling and logging
- **Undo Support** - Commands can be reversed (order cancellation)
- **Batch Operations** - Execute multiple commands with dependency management
- **Confirmation** - User prompts with preview functionality
- **Dry Run Mode** - Test operations without actual execution

### **✅ Task 2.3: Async/Sync Separation** (COMPLETED)
**Impact**: Clean async/sync boundaries eliminating threading complexity

**Created Async Infrastructure**:
- `services/async_trading_service.py` - Pure async trading operations (450+ lines)
- `services/sync_trading_facade.py` - Sync wrapper for CLI commands (300+ lines)
- `websocket/connection_manager.py` - Async WebSocket management (400+ lines)
- `websocket/async_event_loop.py` - Event loop lifecycle management (450+ lines)

**Async Features Implemented**:
- **Async Trading Service** - All operations with async/await
- **Sync Facade** - Clean sync interface wrapping async operations
- **Connection Management** - Proper WebSocket lifecycle with reconnection
- **Event Loop Management** - Graceful startup/shutdown with signal handling
- **Batch Operations** - Concurrent order placement and cancellation
